					<p>Throughout the development of this application profile, we experienced many triumphs, challenges, and issues. We are RDM enthusiasts, influenced by both our work within the DataONE working group at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville’s School of Information Sciences and the Center for Information and Communication Studies, and collaboration on independent RDM projects. As a result, we had a strong foundation in developing the application profile as we are familiar with key DMP elements that support reuse, and understand the drivers influencing DMP use within research data engagement across several environments.</p>
				 	<p>Many of the issues we encountered revolved around ensuring our work in Oxygen to create the XML and XSD was reflective of our users, use cases, and available attributes.  This required careful planning and a thorough literature review to understand how the users, use cases, and available attributes intersect. The actual use of  Oxygen was intuitive, and this made updating the XSD document painless.  In fact, using Oxygen was one of the more enjoyable activities in this assignment, as it allowed us to apply our knowledge of new software and “reverse engineer” the XSD.</p>
					<p>Creating the controlled vocabulary for the softwarePackage/Analysis element was challenging, as there are a variety of software which can be used in any given research and much of this software is not represented within LCSH or LCNAF. The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) from which we derived this element recommends using an external controlled vocabulary, so this was an opportunity to build that into our application profile.  It was incredibly rewarding to create the controlled vocabulary, and envision ways that it may grow in the future to include refinements and additional terms. One of the more significant challenges related to this vocabulary will be taking into account name changes of software, and if any of the platforms cease to exist (as many of the terms represent free and open source software, we will need to regularly check if these platforms still exist).</p>
					<p>The feedback we received on assignments throughout the semester helped us understand items that needed improvement, and gave us the opportunity to improve certain areas.   We incorporated all received feedback in this final iteration of the application profile, including creating wrapper elements and noting relevant attributes available for each element in the specification tables. By overcoming the challenges and issues, we feel confident that our application profile enhances the usability and searchability within DMPHub, and can serve as a resource for other research data management-focused metadata projects.</p>
