					<h2>Introduction to DMPHub</h2>
					<p>We developed a metadata element set for a hypothetical online repository of data management plans (DMPs) called DMPHub. In this scenario, DMPHub is a new service being developed by our Research Data Services team within our academic library, and we both are overseeing the development process. As research data management librarians, we are tasked with forming the application profiles for the platform.</p>
					<p>An increasing amount of funding agencies require DMPs to be submitted at the time of applying for grant funding, for the purpose of ensuring researchers plan to collect, analyze, and secure their data in a manner congruent to the funding agencyâ€™s mission. DMPs are considered to exist within the educational and professional domain of research data management (RDM). In DMPHub, the DMPs are anonymized copies of plans used in grant proposal submissions to funding agencies, including but not limited to the National Science Foundation (U.S.), Belmont Forum (international), National Endowment for the Humanities (U.S.), and Defence Research & Development Organization (India).  In this digital collection, these data management plans are voluntarily provided by university researchers from across the world, and include varying levels of creative commons licensing to guide reuse cases. The collection contains data management plans for grant proposals in multiple research domains, including engineering, mathematics, psychology, computer science, and philosophy. While DMPs can be made in use cases not including applying for grant funding, the purpose of DMPHub is to provide a searchable platform for finding these documents. The only existing platform similar to DMPHub is DMPTool (https://dmptool.org/), a tool for creating appropriate data management plans using funding agency templates. While this tool contains a repository of plans created in DMPTool, the searchability is limited and does not include DMPs created outside DMPTool.</p>
					<h2>Analysis of Objects, Users, and Use Cases</h2>
					<p>Conducting a thorough analysis of the objects in DMPHub helped us identify features that would be important for user tasks in finding, identifying, selecting, and locating DMPs. We completed this analysis through the following steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Identify potential users based on literature review and professional experience in research data management</li>
						<li>Using an exemplar DMP, identify features that are crucial for achieving the goals of DMPHub</li>
						<li>In a network visualization, map features from previous step onto use cases for the platform</li>
						<li>Develop final list of metadata elements to include in application profile for DMPHub</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Step 1: Identify Potential Users</h3>
					<p>We approached the identification of potential users of DMPHub using two methods: (1) literature review and (2) drawing from professional experience in research data management. In the literature review portion, we compiled several scholarly and non-peer reviewed open educational, technical, and R & D resources speaking towards the role of data management plans in the broader ecosystem of research funding and data science. To summarize these resources, we found a diverse user group of DMPs both within and outside of academia, including stakeholders working within data science and software development. The full list of these resources is included in Appendix A.</p>
					<p>In the second stage of the identification of users of DMPHub, we compiled our own experiences as a research data management librarian (Hannah) and an LIS graduate student with interests and research experience in research data management (Leah) to strategize on potential users of this platform. This compilation of experiences included reflections on consultations with researchers to develop DMPs (Hannah), our own research experience as a graduate assistant and postdoc with the DataONE team at UT (Leah and Hannah, respectively), and our coursework within the MSIS program at UT (Leah and Hannah). Figure 1 highlights the results of both stages of this identification process.</p>
