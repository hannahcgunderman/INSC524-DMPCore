						<h2>#1. Introduction to DMPHub</h2>
					</header>
					<p>We developed a metadata element set for a hypothetical online repository of data management plans (DMPs) called DMPHub. In this scenario, DMPHub is a new service being developed by our Research Data Services team within our academic library, and we both are overseeing the development process. As research data management librarians, we are tasked with forming the application profiles for the platform.</p>
					<p>An increasing amount of funding agencies require DMPs to be submitted at the time of applying for grant funding, for the purpose of ensuring researchers plan to collect, analyze, and secure their data in a manner congruent to the funding agency’s mission. DMPs are considered to exist within the educational and professional domain of research data management (RDM). In DMPHub, the DMPs are anonymized copies of plans used in grant proposal submissions to funding agencies, including but not limited to the National Science Foundation (U.S.), Belmont Forum (international), National Endowment for the Humanities (U.S.), and Defence Research & Development Organization (India).  In this digital collection, these data management plans are voluntarily provided by university researchers from across the world, and include varying levels of creative commons licensing to guide reuse cases. The collection contains data management plans for grant proposals in multiple research domains, including engineering, mathematics, psychology, computer science, and philosophy. While DMPs can be made in use cases not including applying for grant funding, the purpose of DMPHub is to provide a searchable platform for finding these documents. The only existing platform similar to DMPHub is DMPTool (https://dmptool.org/), a tool for creating appropriate data management plans using funding agency templates. While this tool contains a repository of plans created in DMPTool, the searchability is limited and does not include DMPs created outside DMPTool.</p>

					<h2>#2. Analysis of Objects, Users, and Use Cases</h2>
					<p>Conducting a thorough analysis of the objects in DMPHub helped us identify features that would be important for user tasks in finding, identifying, selecting, and locating DMPs. We completed this analysis through the following steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Identify potential users based on literature review and professional experience in research data management</li>
						<li>Using an exemplar DMP, identify features that are crucial for achieving the goals of DMPHub</li>
						<li>In a network visualization, map features from previous step onto use cases for the platform</li>
						<li>Develop final list of metadata elements to include in application profile for DMPHub</li>
					</ol>		
					<h3>Step 1: Identify Potential Users</h3>
					<p>We approached the identification of potential users of DMPHub using two methods: (1) literature review and (2) drawing from professional experience in research data management. In the literature review portion, we compiled several scholarly and non-peer reviewed open educational, technical, and R & D resources speaking towards the role of data management plans in the broader ecosystem of research funding and data science. To summarize these resources, we found a diverse user group of DMPs both within and outside of academia, including stakeholders working within data science and software development. The full list of these resources can be viewed here.</p>
					<p>In the second stage of the identification of users of DMPHub, we compiled our own experiences as a research data management librarian (Hannah) and an LIS graduate student with interests and research experience in research data management (Leah) to strategize on potential users of this platform. This compilation of experiences included reflections on consultations with researchers to develop DMPs (Hannah), our own research experience as a graduate assistant and postdoc with the DataONE team at UT (Leah and Hannah, respectively), and our coursework within the MSIS program at UT (Leah and Hannah). Figure 1 highlights the results of both stages of this identification process.</p>

					<h3>Step 2: Identify Features Crucial for Achieving Goals of DMPHub</h3>
					<p>In this step, we consulted DMPTool (https://dmptool.org/) and selected an example of a comprehensive DMP addressing all necessary areas required in these plans. We went through this DMP and highlighted the areas that would be most important as metadata elements in a DMP repository. Below, we have included a link to this exemplar DMP with the areas we highlighted as information that would enable the finding, identifying, selecting, and locating of DMPs (note: this DMP is freely available and licensed for reuse without removal of identifying names and affiliations). After the DMP, we include annotations of each highlighted area to provide rationale for why we consider these features crucial in achieving the goals of DMPHub we outlined in Section 1.</p>

					<p><strong>Rationale of Highlighted Areas in DMP</strong></p>
					<p><em><u>Tools and Templates Used to Create DMP</u></em></p>
					<p>As an increasing amount of funding agencies require researchers to submit DMPs with their grant proposals, more tools and boilerplate language exists for the creation of DMPs. That being said, some researchers continue to create DMPs from scratch without following a specific template or using a tool. Individuals searching for DMPs on DMPHub may want to distinguish their search by DMPs created within an existing platform such as DMPTool, or created from scratch by the researcher.</p>
					<p><em><u>Creator</u></em></p>
					<p>As DMPs become more common in academic research and conversations continue to grow around RDM, certain scholars and LIS professionals may begin to develop positive reputations as stewards of data management based on the quality of their DMPs. The creator of the DMP is an important area to highlight, as users may want to find DMPs associated with certain individuals known within their field. Note: the creator may be different than the Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI (see below).</p>
					<p><em><u>Affiliation</u></em></p>
					<p>This refers to the affiliation of the creator of the DMP. Users may wish to find DMPs created within their higher education setting or in another department of interest. Users may also want to distinguish between creators affiliated with an academic department, and those working as research data management professionals in academic libraries or similar LIS settings.</p>
					<p><em><u>Funding Agency</u></em></p>
					<p>Most federally-funded scientific funding agencies require researchers to submit DMPs at the time of submitting grant proposals. However, education and training around creating DMPs falls behind in many settings, leaving researchers with less guidance on creating the DMP. DMPHub allows these researchers to seek guidance on writing their DMP. The funding agency for which the DMP is being created in conjunction with a grant proposal is an important distinguishing factor among DMPs. Depending on the funding agency, the features required among the DMPs may vary.</p>
					<p><em><u>Copyright Information</u></em></p>
					<p>As more researchers make their DMPs public for educational purposes, they must also consider how they want their name and DMP contents to be reused. It is beneficial for users of DMPHub to search for DMPs they can directly adapt their own DMPs from, or reuse in educational/training sessions on RDM. Searching by copyright information surrounding the DMP allows for such use cases.</p>
					<p><em><u>PI or Co-PI</u></em></p>
					<p>The PI or Co-PI listed in the DMP may differ from the creator of the DMP, as more researchers are eliciting the services and experience of RDM professionals to collaborate on or completely lead the creation of the DMP. We want users of DMPHub to have the flexibility to search for DMPs affiliated with certain figures in their academic field or another field of interest, whether or not they are the creators of the DMP itself.</p>
					<p><em><u>Academic Domain</u></em></p>
					<p>The academic domain which is tied to the DMP is an important distinguishing factor; DMPs created in STEM fields, for example, will vary in data type, data management techniques, and data sharing protocol than DMPs created in the social sciences and humanities. There is also variability within DMP elements across STEM, and similarly, across the social sciences. Creating a metadata element allowing users to search by academic domain increases the possible use cases of DMPHub. Note: the domain may overlap with the affiliation information present within the DMP. We believe this should be a separate element, as affiliation information alone may not provide full insight on the academic domain from which the DMP is derived.</p>
					<p><em><u>Affiliated Websites</u></em></p>
					<p>Websites which will host either the data outputs, or exist in direct conjunction with and tied to the research, are an important factor within a DMP. Individuals working in research environments who wish to see the DMPs affiliated with a certain website would appreciate a metadata element allowing for searchability by this area.</p>
					<p><em><u>Types and Sizes of Datasets</u></em></p>
					<p>Datasets containing small total amounts of data will have a different management scheme than research using big data and archiving several terabytes of data. Further, the type of data will require different management techniques, such as transcripts from ethnographic interviews to machine learning algorithms. In consideration of the use cases of DMPs, researchers developing DMPs may wish to search for DMPs discussing data management for sizes and types of data similar to those within their own projects.</p>
					<p><em><u>Storage of Datasets including Repositories</u></em></p>
					<p>Several funding agencies require researchers to place their data outputs into a repository for public access. The type of storage (including these data repositories) is an important distinguishing factor in DMPs. Repositories may include, for example, figshare, institutional repositories, and domain-specific repositories. Users who are considering using a certain data repository may wish to see DMPs engaging with the same repository for guidance.</p>
					<p><em><u>Tools and Methods used for Data Analysis</u></em></p>
					<p>Specific methods and tools for data analysis are necessary elements in DMPs, and for users of DMPHub, they may wish to view DMPs for projects using only certain types of data analysis. This could include software, methods of analysis (statistical methods, network analyses, GIS, etc.), and standalone tools such as OpenRefine.</p>
					<p><em><u>Embargoes</u></em></p>
					<p>Data embargoes refer to data which have been submitted and archived in a repository, but are not available for download for a certain period of time. Users who are designing DMPs and wanting to place embargoes on their data release (for publication, funding, or other reasons) may wish to find DMPs with similar embargo information to use as reference.</p>
					<p><em><u>Data Access and Rights</u></em></p>
					<p>Federally-funded research projects often require public access to the data outputs. However, some of the data may prevent security and/or confidentiality issues, and require policies on reuse. Even in cases of data sharing, researchers can place several limitations on the reuse cases of the data. Users who are designing DMPs and wanting to place certain restrictions on data access and reuse within and after their projects (for publication, funding, or other reasons) may wish to find DMPs with similar rights information to use as reference.</p>
					<p><em><u>Associated Institutions</u></em></p>
					<p>Several funding agencies, including the NSF and the Belmont Forum, require collaborative proposals that involve research across several institutions, with the development of partnerships with institutions not directly involved in the research. Users may wish to search for DMPs whose described data outputs will be connected with or linked to a certain institution, and having a metadata element with this information captured increases the use cases of DMPHub. Note: this differs from the affiliation and academic domain, and refers to institutions having connections to the research planned in the DMP, but not direct affiliations of the creator and/or PI or Co-PI.</p>
					<h3>Step 3: Map Features onto Use Cases</h3>
					<p>From our literature review, synthesis of professional and educational experiences in RDM and DMPs, we identified a set of core use cases from which we mapped several of the core features of a DMP. Figure 2 demonstrates these use cases, and examples of the elements we listed in Step 2 that would most strongly be associated with DMPHub searching behaviors in those use cases. These use cases influenced the next stage of our development process: searching for existing and relevant metadata standards from which we could capture our desired elements for DMPHub.</p>

	<!-- Relevant Metadata Standards -->

			<section id="main">

					<h2>#3. Relevant Metadata Standards</h2>
					<p>After examining data points commonly captured in DMPs, we determined that the fifteen elements in the Dublin Core (DC) schema could be matched to most of the fields identified. As Weibel notes, DC "is intended to be used by non‐catalogers” (2005), which may be appealing to researchers using DMPHub. Using a simple schema will reduce end-user confusion and make the DMP searching process less complex for researchers. We also consulted metadata standards from the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) for metadata standards specific to describing datasets. For the few DMP elements that did not have a good match in DC, proprietary fields are created using the utk namespace. In these cases, there may be a similar metadata element in an existing standard, but the specifications and descriptions of these elements did not appropriately connect to the users, use cases, and overall goals of DMPHub, and we therefore chose to use the utk namespace in these cases.</p>
					<p>After parsing through existing metadata standards, we ended with this final list of standards in which we would reuse qualifiers:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Dublin Core: <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/" target=”_blank”>https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/</a></li>
						<li>Dublin Core Terms namespace: <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/2012-06-14/" target=”_blank”>https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/2012-06-14/</a></li>
						<li>Data Documentation Initiative: <a href="https://ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies" target=”_blank”>https://ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies</a></li>
						<li>Data Catalog Vocabulary: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/" target=”_blank”>https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/</a></li>
					</ol>
					<p>We also explored the controlled vocabularies used within these metadata standards, and assigned these vocabularies where applicable to the value spaces of our element set (see Table 2 in <a href="analysis.html">Analysis of the Domain)</a>.</p>
					<p>As the open science and RDM initiatives continue to take hold in the spheres of academic research and reproducibility, we expect that the number of metadata standards aimed at interoperability with data will increase, particularly with elements relating to DMPs. Until that time, we will utilize the utk namespace for the DMP-specific elements of our element set.</p>

	<!-- Justification for Application Profile -->

					<h2>#4. Justification for an Application Profile</h2>
					<p>Given the increasing rate at which funding agencies are requiring DMPs at the time of requesting funding, combined with a growing need for standardized research data management education across LIS environments, an application profile for metadata pertaining to DMPs is needed to help standarize how these resources are indexed and found online. While online resources such as DMPTool exist which provide access to DMPs, the search function is limited and as a result, it can be difficult to find representative DMPs for a given domain, funding agency, and data type. This application profile alleviates those issues by defining an element set which captures several important elements of a DMP, including but not limited to creator, domain, data type, analysis type, and storage locations.</p>
